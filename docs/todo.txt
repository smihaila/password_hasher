- Add log messages, and abundantly.

- Unit + Integration Tests using BDD G-W-T style (Go-equivalent to Ruby's RSpec and C#' MSpec and RSpec).

- Add a Salt / Initialization Vector concept to password hashing.

- Allow the Hashing / Digest algorithm to be configurable.

- Add CORS support.

- Swagger / OpenAPI docs.

- Add AuthN support (via OAuth 2 or via custom "users" SQL / NoSQL DB persistence layer. Maybe we could go with an
  ApiKey concept as starting point for AuthN.

- Add an in-memory Caching layer.

- Dramatically increase app's overall scalability by leveraging CoackroackDB as NoSQL Data Layer. Unfortunately,
  CoackroachDB is NOT available on Windows 7, only on Windows 8 and up. I was unable to use it on my Win 7 dev PC.
  Use Win 10, a Docker container image or VirtualBox Linux VM.

- Maybe leverage CQRS + Event pattern to separate the Write operations from Reads.
